# Tasks

## Plugins

1. Use `CLINE` plugin to run e2e tests and provide summary including improvements.
2. Use `Continue.dev` plugin to prepare "backend/use_cases/auth_use_cases.py" for PR review.

## Tools
1. Use `aider` to read README.md and improve app by providing users to vote (up vote and down vote) for comments (rating field) by introducing new endpoints as all users should be able to do that.
2. Use `OpenHands` to read README.md and add new feature "AI enabler", UI should have a new link to "AI page", which contains input field and response placeholder, that input is directed to backend, which in turn uses AI (claude 3.5 Haiku) with agent framework with tooling support to execute actions user requested. AI should return HTML content that should be rendered in UI as-is inside of the placeholder.
